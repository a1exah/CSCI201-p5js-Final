# CSCI201-p5js-Final (Bouncing Ball Modified)

This is a modified version of Professor Meng's p5 project featuring graphic of bouncing balls. Three alterations were made to the original program. 
The first is that the balls change color when they come in contact with a wall. Additionally, the location and shape of the object where the test 
lies was changed. Lastly, a new font and text style was applied to the "Hello World!" text. Note the image below is simply a still of the moving video 
that the program produces.
